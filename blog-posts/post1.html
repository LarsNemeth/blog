      The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber of
      the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself is a perennial in the
      nightshade family, Solanaceae.[2] Wild potato species, originating in
      modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from Canada to
      southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have been
      domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in
      multiple locations,[4] but later genetic testing of the wide variety of
      cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the
      area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a
      species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated
      approximately 7,000â€“10,000 years ago.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of
      South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of
      the potato are cultivated.
