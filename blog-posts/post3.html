      The chili pepper (also chile, chile pepper, chilli pepper, or chilli[3]),
      from Nahuatl chīlli (Nahuatl pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːlːi] (About this
      soundlisten)), is the fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum which are
      members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.[4] Chili peppers are widely
      used in many cuisines as a spice to add heat to dishes. The substances
      giving chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically
      are capsaicin and related compounds known as capsaicinoids. Chili peppers
      originated in Mexico.[5] After the Columbian Exchange, many cultivars of
      chili pepper spread across the world, used for both food and traditional
      medicine. This diversity has lead to a wide variety of varieties and
      cultivars, including the annuum species, with its glabriusculum variety
      and New Mexico cultivar group, and the species of baccatum, chinense,
      frutescens, and pubescens. Cultivars grown in North America and Europe are
      believed to all derive from Capsicum annuum, and have white, yellow, red
      or purple to black fruits. In 2016, the world's production of raw green
      chili peppers amounted to 34.5 million tons, with China producing half.[6]
