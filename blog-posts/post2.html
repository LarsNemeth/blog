      The traditional cocktail known as a Black Russian, which first appeared in
      1949, becomes a White Russian with the addition of cream. Neither drink
      has any known Russian origin, but both are so-named due to vodka being the
      primary ingredient. It is unclear which drink preceded the other.[1][2]
      The Oxford English Dictionary[3] refers to the first mention of the word
      "White Russian" in the sense of a cocktail as appearing in California's
      Oakland Tribune on November 21, 1965.[4] It was placed in the newspaper as
      an insert: "White Russian. 1 oz. each Southern, vodka, cream",[5] with
      "Southern" referring to Coffee Southern, a short-lived brand of coffee
      liqueur by Southern Comfort.[6] The White Russian saw a surge in
      popularity after the 1998 release of the film The Big Lebowski. Throughout
      the movie, it appears as the beverage of choice for the protagonist,
      Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski. On a number of occasions he refers to the
      drink as a "Caucasian".[7]
